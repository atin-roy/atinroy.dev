## 🎓 Recommended Learning Path

### Month 1: Frontend Foundation
- Calculator App → Weather App → Quiz App
- Outcome: Solid React fundamentals

### Month 2: Full-Stack Intro
- **Todo App** (start here for backend!)
- GitHub User Explorer (APIs & caching)
- Outcome: Can build simple full-stack projects

### Month 3: Database Mastery
- Blog Platform (complex relationships)
- Task Scheduler (background jobs)
- Outcome: Confident with databases & Spring Boot

### Month 4+: Advanced Systems
- Real-Time Chat (WebSockets)
- E-Commerce OR Recommendation Engine
- Outcome: Can architect production systems

### Parallel: Python/ML
Run these alongside web projects:
- Iris → House Price → MNIST → Sentiment Analysis

## 🔧 How to Use a Project

### Step 1: Read the Project File
```
Open: docs/project-ideas/[tier]/[project-name].md
Review: Learning goals, user stories, bonus features
```

### Step 2: Create a Plan
```
Use: @project-ideas: Create a plan for [Project Name]
Output: docs/project-ideas/plans/[project]-plan.md
```

### Step 3: Follow the Plan
```
Your plan includes:
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Daily milestones
- Common pitfalls & solutions
- Key resources
- Success checkpoints
```

### Step 4: Build & Track
```
Follow the plan, write code, commit regularly
Document learnings as you go
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small** - Don't jump to E-Commerce as your first project
2. **Build to Break** - Make mistakes, that's where learning happens
3. **Commit Often** - Push working code frequently
4. **Document** - Write down learnings in each project
5. **Test as You Go** - Don't leave testing for the end
6. **Deploy** - Push each project to production
7. **Share** - Show your work, get feedback
8. **Focus** - Finish projects before starting new ones

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing a project, you should be able to:

✅ Explain what it does and why  
✅ Defend your architectural decisions  
✅ Extend it with new features  
✅ Debug any issues that arise  
✅ Deploy it to production  
✅ Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
