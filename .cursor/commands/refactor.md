# Refactoring Request

Refactor the selected code to improve clarity, performance, or modularity.

## Guidelines

1. **Modern Syntax:** Use modern Java (records, var) or Python or the concerned file type language (comprehensions, type hints) features.
2. **Early Returns:** Flatten nested if/else blocks.
3. **Immutability:** Prefer immutable data structures where possible.
4. **Separation of Concerns:** Break large functions into smaller, single-purpose helpers.

## Output

- Show the **Diff** or the new code block.
- Explain **Why** you made these specific changes (e.g., "Switched to HashMap for O(1) lookup").
