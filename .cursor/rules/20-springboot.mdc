# BACKEND STACK & RULES

- **Framework:** Spring Boot (Java 25+).
- **Style:** Prefer `record` classes for DTOs and strict Dependency Injection.
- **Package Manager:** Maven or Gradle.

## When to use Spring Boot

- Auth is required.
- User data persistence is required.
- Complex business logic exists.
- **DO NOT USE** if: No auth, no DB, simple API wrapping.

## Code Style

- Use industry standards.
- Modular code.
- Extensive comments only on _complex_ logic.
